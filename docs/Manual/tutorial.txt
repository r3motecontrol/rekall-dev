The main goals of the Rekall framework are to enhance user experience by making
common tasks easier and more intuitive as well as provide a powerful and capable
interface for automation and performing more complex operations.


Installation
------------

Rekall is available as a python package installable via the pip package
manager. We support running Rekall under a virtualenv environment (This
guarantees that the exact versions of all dependencies are met).

Simply type (for example on Linux):

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
$ virtualenv  /tmp/MyEnv
New python executable in /tmp/MyEnv/bin/python
Installing setuptools, pip...done.
$ source /tmp/MyEnv/bin/activate
$ pip install rekall
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

To have all the dependencies installed. You still need to have python and pip
installed first.

To be able to run the Rekall GUI, you will need to install the `rekall-gui`
package:

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
$ pip install rekall-gui
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

For windows, Rekall is also available as a self contained installer
package. Please check the download page for the most appropriate installer to
use.

A Rekall walkthrough
--------------------

This section is a quick tour of the Rekall user interface. The program can
accept command line options - which we can learn more about by using the --help
option (Abbreviates to show only the important options):

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
$ rekal -h
usage: rekal [-p PROFILE] [-v] [-q] [--debug] [--output_style {concise,full}]
             [--logging_level {DEBUG,INFO,WARNING,ERROR,CRITICAL}]
...
             [--version] [-]

Output control:
  -v, --verbose         Set logging to debug level.
  --output_style {concise,full}
                        How much information to show. Default is 'concise'.
  --plugin [PLUGIN [PLUGIN ...]]
                        Load user provided plugin bundle.
  -h, --help            Show help about global paramters.
  --cache {file,memory,timed}
                        Type of cache to use.
  --repository_path [REPOSITORY_PATH [REPOSITORY_PATH ...]]
                        Path to search for profiles. This can take any form
                        supported by the IO Manager (e.g. zip files,
                        directories, URLs etc)
  -f FILENAME, --filename FILENAME
                        The raw image to load.
  --live                Enable live memory analysis.
  --version             Prints the Rekall version and exits.

Interface:
  --pager PAGER         The pager to use when output is larger than a screen
                        full.
  -F {text,json,wide,xls,test,data}, --format {text,json,wide,xls,test,data}
                        The output format to use. Default (text)
  --timezone TIMEZONE   Timezone to output all times (e.g. Australia/Sydney).

Plugin shell options:
  -p PROFILE, --profile PROFILE
                        Name of the profile to load. This is the filename of
                        the profile found in the profiles directory. Profiles
                        are searched in the profile path order.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Some of the most frequently used flags are described below:

--verbose::
This is a shorthand to setting the logging level to DEBUG. Rekall will produce
debug messages of its operation. You should use this if you want to know more of
what Rekall is doing and also to attach output for bug reports.

--plugin::
If provided, Rekall loads this python file at start time. The file may define
any plugins, overlays etc which might add additional functionality to Rekall.

--cache::
Rekall has a caching mechanism to be able to remember important information
about images in between executions. When Rekall starts up it looks in the cache
to see if this particular image has been previously analyzed. This allows Rekall
to load previously derived data from cache instead of recalculating it. There
are 3 cache modes: `file` is the usual persistant cache (by default in
~/.rekall-cache). `memory` cache is only present in memory for the life of this
process. `timed` cache is used for live images which keep changing (it is
essentially a memory cache which is flushed periodically).

--repository_path::
Rekall normally loads the required profiles from a profile repository. By
default, Rekall will use the rekall public repository. If you do not have
internet access or want to host the repository locally, you can use `git clone`
to copy the entire repository somewhere and then specify --repository_path to
indicate where profiles should be loaded.

--filename::
The '--filename' option is the name of the image to analyse. If you are using
the raw device as provided by the winpmem driver, this will be '\\.\pmem'
(windows) for example or '/proc/kcore' (linux). You almost always want to specify
a filename to operate on. A notable exception is when using the '--live' option
which will set the appropriate filename automatically.

--live::
The '--live' option enables live memory analysis. Note that you would usually need to be
running as `root` to do this. When running on Windows, Rekall will insert the
winpmem driver. On OSX, Rekall will insert the macpmem driver. On Linux, Rekall
will attempt to use the `/proc/kcore` memory device. When specifying this option
you do not need to specify the --filename option because Rekall will
automatically open the right device. When Rekall exits, the driver will be
unloaded.

--profile::
The '--profile' flag specifies the profile to use. The profile is a JSON file
with operating system specific data used to parse the data structures in the
image. The profile used must exactly match the operating system version in the
image. This parameter is usually only needed if you are generating your own
profile (e.g. when analyzing an unusual Linux system). Profiles are normally
autodetected in Rekall and are not usually specified by the user.

--pager::
The pager can be specified as the program that will be used to inspect the
result of each plugin. Since many plugins produce a great deal of output text, a
pager is often needed. Rekall will write the output to a temporary
file, and launch this program to view it. For example, on windows it is useful
to use notepad to examine the output from each plugin (e.g. '--pager notepad'). On
linux use '--pager less' for example, or even '--pager "gvim -f"'.

--format::
Rekall output is produced in a number of formats. The default format is 'text'
which consists of tabulated human readable output. The `wide` format produces
expanded rows (useful for very wide tables with many columns). Often it is
useful to further process the output by machine. In that case the 'data' format
can be used to produce machine parsable JSON data. Rekall can also produce an
Excel compatible spreadsheet (if you have the `openpyxl` package installed).

--timezone::
Internally Rekall always works with times in UTC (i.e. without a timezone)
however it is often convenient to output data in a particular timezone. Use this
option to cause output to be produced in that timezone. Note that Rekall always
fully specifies all times so it does not really matter what timezone you use for
output. For example specify `--timezone Australia/Sydney` will cause timestamps
to be written as '2012-10-02 07:39:51+1000' instead of '2012-10-01 21:39:51Z'

The Rekall architecture is built around 'plugins'. A plugin is an extension with
a name (e.g. pslist) which produces some analysis tasks and generates some
output. There are many Rekall plugins for many operating systems and
configurations. Not all plugins are applicable for all images. For example, a
plugin which is designed to work on Windows 7 will not be active on a Windows XP
image.

Similarly we try to keep the names of plugins consistent across operating
systems. For example, the pslist plugin is named the same for all operating
systems, even though it is actually implemented by different code for each OSX.

The interactive shell::
If the command is followed by a plugin name, the tool will not use the
interactive shell, but rather run the plugin and exit:

.Example: Running plugin from command line.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
$ rekal -f xp-laptop-2005-06-25.img pslist
Offset (V) Name                    PID   PPID   Thds     Hnds   Sess  Wow64 Start                Exit
---------- -------------------- ------ ------ ------ -------- ------ ------ -------------------- --------------------

...
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Some command plugins use additional options specific to their module. You can
read plugin specific help by specifying the '--help' option after the name of the
plugin:

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
$ rekal -f xp-laptop-2005-06-25.img pslist --help
usage: rekal pslist [-h] [--kdbg KDBG] [--eprocess EPROCESS [EPROCESS ...]]
                     [--phys_eprocess PHYS_EPROCESS [PHYS_EPROCESS ...]]
                     [--pid PID [PID ...]] [--proc_regex PROC_REGEX]

List processes for windows.

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  --eprocess EPROCESS [EPROCESS ...]
                        Kernel addresses of eprocess structs.
  --phys_eprocess PHYS_EPROCESS [PHYS_EPROCESS ...]
                        Physical addresses of eprocess structs.
  --pid PID [PID ...]   One or more pids of processes to select.
  --proc_regex PROC_REGEX
                        A regex to select a profile by name.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

[NOTE]
================================================================================
Because Rekall does not know which specific plugin will handle a particular
plugin name until it inspects the image, it is essential that the image be
specified with the --filename arg. If this is not specified, Rekall must assume
there is no such plugin (so above `rekal pslist -h` will not work because Rekall
does not know which version of pslist we are searching for).

For this reason we recommend that users use the interactive mode as much as
possible (see below).
================================================================================

For example to list all the *svchost* processes, we can apply a regex to process
names:

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
$ rekal -f xp-laptop-2005-06-25.img pslist --proc_regex svc
Offset (V) Name                    PID   PPID   Thds     Hnds   Sess  Wow64 Start                Exit
---------- -------------------- ------ ------ ------ -------- ------ ------ -------------------- --------------------
0x81fa5aa0 svchost.exe             740    580     17      198      0  False 2005-06-25 16:47:32  -
0x81fa8650 svchost.exe             800    580     10      302      0  False 2005-06-25 16:47:33  -
0x81faba78 svchost.exe             840    580     83     1589      0  False 2005-06-25 16:47:33  -
0x81f8dda0 svchost.exe             984    580      6       90      0  False 2005-06-25 16:47:35  -
0x81f6e7e8 svchost.exe            1024    580     15      207      0  False 2005-06-25 16:47:35  -
0x82081da0 svchost.exe            1484    580      6      119      0  False 2005-06-25 16:47:59  -

The interactive shell marks input lines with the name of the image and a time of
day. In order to run a plugin simply type its name and press enter:

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
[1] win7.elf 13:54:24> pslist   <1>

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

<1> The user enters the bare word pslist as a command.
<2> IPython is configured for auto-execution and assumed the user wants to run a
function called pslist()

Plugins appear as functions in the namespace the shell is running in. IPython
sees the bare word 'pslist' and assumes you mean to run the function
'pslist()'. Running this function will render the output to the screen.

All plugins which are applicable to the current image and profile are also
collected in the variable 'plugins' in the namespace. This means we can use
command line completion to discover all the plugins we could use on the current
image:

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
In [3]: plugins.[tab][tab]
plugins.callbacks    plugins.handles      plugins.modules      plugins.raw2dmp
plugins.cmdscan      plugins.hashdump     plugins.mutantscan   plugins.regdump
plugins.connections  plugins.hivedump     plugins.null         plugins.sockets
plugins.connscan     plugins.hivescan     plugins.pas2vas      plugins.svcscan
plugins.consoles     plugins.impscan      plugins.pedump       plugins.symlinkscan
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

To learn more about each of these plugins we can follow the name of the plugin
with a single question mark:
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
[1] win7.elf 13:56:55> plugins.pslist?
file:       /home/scudette/rekall/rekall-core/rekall/plugins/windows/taskmods.py
Plugin:     WinPsList (pslist)
Parameters:
  profile:       Name of the profile to load. This is the filename of the profile found in the profiles directory. Profiles are searched in the profile path order.
  dtb:           The DTB physical address. (type: IntParser)
  eprocess:      Kernel addresses of eprocess structs. (type: ArrayIntParser)
  phys_eprocess: Physical addresses of eprocess structs. (type: ArrayIntParser)
  pid:           One or more pids of processes to select. (type: ArrayIntParser)
  proc_regex:    A regex to select a process by name. (type: RegEx)
  method:        Method to list processes (Default uses all methods). (type: ChoiceArray)
Docstring:  List processes for windows.
Link:       http://www.rekall-forensic.com/epydocs/rekall.plugins.windows.taskmods.WinPsList-class.html
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Following the name of the plugin with two question marks lists the source of the
plugin as well:
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
[1] win7.elf 13:58:57> plugins.pslist??
file:       /home/scudette/rekall/rekall-core/rekall/plugins/windows/taskmods.py
Plugin:     WinPsList (pslist)
Parameters:
  profile:       Name of the profile to load. This is the filename of the profile found in the profiles directory. Profiles are searched in the profile path order.
  dtb:           The DTB physical address. (type: IntParser)
  eprocess:      Kernel addresses of eprocess structs. (type: ArrayIntParser)
  phys_eprocess: Physical addresses of eprocess structs. (type: ArrayIntParser)
  pid:           One or more pids of processes to select. (type: ArrayIntParser)
  proc_regex:    A regex to select a process by name. (type: RegEx)
  method:        Method to list processes (Default uses all methods). (type: ChoiceArray)
Docstring:  List processes for windows.
Link:       http://www.rekall-forensic.com/epydocs/rekall.plugins.windows.taskmods.WinPsList-class.html
source:
class WinPsList(common.WinProcessFilter):
    """List processes for windows."""

    __name = "pslist"

    eprocess = None

    @classmethod
    def args(cls, metadata):
        super(WinPsList, cls).args(metadata)
        metadata.set_description("""
        Lists the processes by following the _EPROCESS.PsActiveList.

        In the windows operating system, processes are linked together through a
        doubly linked list. This plugin follows the list around, printing
        information about each process.

        To begin, we need to find any element on the list. This can be done by:

        1) Obtaining the _KDDEBUGGER_DATA64.PsActiveProcessHead - debug
           information.

        2) Finding any _EPROCESS in memory (e.g. through psscan) and following
           its list.

        This plugin supports both approaches.
        """)
...
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

This is useful in order to verify how a particular plugin works. Note that
commandline completion can be used to speed up plugin selection and arguments
for plugins:
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
[1] win7.elf 14:01:37> plugins.ps[tab][tab]
plugins.pslist   plugins.psscan   plugins.pstree   plugins.psxview
[1] win7.elf 14:01:37> plugins.pslist [tab][tab]
dtb=            eprocess=       method=         phys_eprocess=  pid=            proc_regex=     profile=
[1] win7.elf 14:01:37> plugins.pslist pr[tab][tab]
proc_regex=  profile=
[1] win7.elf 14:01:37> plugins.pslist proc_regex="svc"
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

We can now specify the parameters to be passed to the plugin (This is the same
as the command line example above):

.Example: Specifying plugin options in the interactive shell.

The interactive shell is the most powerful and flexible interface and so the
remainder of this tutorial will focus on it.

At the heart of the interactive interface is the session object. The session is
an object which contains information about the current image analysis.

It follows that after running the pslist() plugin for the first time, a number
of new objects are stored in the session, and they can be reused the second time
a pslist() is run. At any time we can view the current session by simply
printing it:

We can see that the session contains two parts - a configuration part and a
cache. The cache will store files in the specified directory. The session shows
us the content of the cache.

default_address_space::
The default_address_space is the address space that will be used to instantiate
new objects from the interactive shell by default. When reading memory we must
always use an address space. For example, we can use the physical address space
(i.e. the raw image) or a virtual address space (for example, the kernel or any
process's address space). Many plugins rely on the correct default address space
to be used. This is typically known as the 'Process Context' and can be changed
using the `cc` plugin. By default the default_address_space is set to the
kernel's address space.

For example, suppose we want to examine the process listing from earlier in more
details. The process list has a column with a name `_EPROCESS` indicating this
is the address of the kernel's _EPROCESS struct. Rekall typically lists the
names and addresses of critical kernel data structures in its tabular output.

Suppose we now wish to examine the _EPROCESS object reported by the pslist
module above for pid 768. We read the virtual offset of the process as
0xfa80024589e0 in the default address space. We first create an instance of the
_EPROCESS at the reported offset, and assign it to a variable. We then can
examine all the fields of this struct by using command line completion (double
tab):

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
[1] win7.elf 14:15:58> task = session.profile._EPROCESS(0xfa80024589e0)
[1] win7.elf 14:19:57> task.
Display all 180 possibilities? (y or n)
task.AccountingFolded              task.Flags                         task.OtherOperationCount           task.SectionBaseAddress            task.cast
...
[1] win7.elf 14:19:57> task.UniqueProcessId
               Out<19 >  [unsigned int:UniqueProcessId]: 0x00000300
[1] win7.elf 14:20:08> task.Ima

[1] win7.elf 14:20:08> task.ImageFileName
               Out<20 >  [String:ImageFileName]: 'svchost.exe\x00'
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

When examining a member in a struct (such as '_EPROCESS.ImageFileName') we
receive an instance of a rekall 'BaseObject'. This has both a type
(e.g. 'String') and a name (e.g. 'ImageFileName') as well as a human readable
representation (e.g. svchost.exe).

For example in the task object we have a type of '_EPROCESS' (which is a
struct), and it exists at offset 0x81fa5aa0:

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
In [13]: task
Out[13]: [_EPROCESS _EPROCESS] @ 0x81FA5AA0
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

To view the entire object we can print it (you can use the shortcut 'p' as a
shortcut for 'print' - either will work).

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
[1] win7.elf 14:20:14> p task

  0x1B8 CommitCharge                  [unsigned long long:CommitCharge]: 0x00000D7F
...
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

This view shows the layout of the _EPROCESS struct which is overlayed on the
offset 0xFA80024589E0. The first column is the relative offset of each member,
followed by the name of each member and a representation of each member. This
representation consists of a type (e.g. _KPROCESS), a name (e.g. Pcb) and a
human readable representation.

Interactive plugins
-------------------

Rekall is more than just a framework for running plugins. It is a complete
interactive environment for memory analysis. Many of the more interesting
features Rekall provides exist as part of the interactive environment.

The Address Resolver.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A large part of Memory analysis is about emulating the execution environment of
running code. When code is executed it can access and branch into different
addresses in the Virtual Address Space. It is Rekall's job to learn what exists
at different addresses. The address space is divided into parts and Rekall can
keep track of what different addresses mean.

The Address Resolver is a special component which keeps track of the memroy
layout in the virtual address space. This service can answer:

1. What is found in a specific address?
2. What is the address of a given symbol?

In order to efficiently represent memory addresses Rekall uses a specific
notation:

* First a module name is specified. This can be the name of a kernel module, or dll.
* Then the ! character is used to separate the module name from the symbol name.
* A symbol name is specified in the module.
* Possible offset from the symbol name.

The following are all valid examples:

<1> Disassembly of a kernel function. The "nt" symbol always refers to the kernel.
<2> Disassembly of a python extension (a dll). (The cc plugin was run to set the
    process context).
<3> The Address Resolver is also used inside plugins to resolve addresses where
    needed. For example here, We see a move instruction from the constant
    'python27!PyType_Type' (i.e. the python Type type). This makes it very easy
    to see how assembly code interacts with the rest of the address space.

Similarly the 'dump' plugin dumps a hexdump of some memory, but it is able to
annotate information about what resides in each address:

Note the names of symbols residing in nearby memory addresses.

The Rekall Session
------------------

Rekall uses a `Session` to encapsulate the analysis of a single image. The
reason Rekall is so fast is because information is cached in the
session. Normally when running from the interactive console, the session
persists in memory and therefore, the cache remains available for subsequent
modules.

For example, when running the `pslist` module, Rekall caches all the known
processes within the image. This cache is then subsequently used by all plugins
which require process listing information (e.g. those plugins which can be
filtered by process id, process name, etc).

You can see this by printing the session object:

}
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

As can be been above, the session state can be divided into the configuration,
and the cache. In the above case the cache is persistent (It is a FileCache) and
stores a number of useful objects (e.g. the various output, the process listing
techniques). Note that the cache will only show objects currently loaded
(i.e. have been used in this run). There may be other objects on disk.

If Rekall is analysing a volatile image - such as a memory device, the cache
will not be persistent - instead it will be time based, to allow items to expire
promptly from the cache as the live system evolves. For normal images, the cache
may persist so that even if the user quits and restarts Rekall on the same
image, the cache is considered valid. This significatly speeds up operations in
future on the same image.

If you suspect something unusual with the cache (e.g. the cache is out of sync
or was created by an earlier version) it should be quite safe to remove all
files from the cache directory. Otherwise you can force the memory cache to be
used by issuing the `--cache memory` flag.

[NOTE]
The on disk version of the session cache is considered an ephemeral cache of the
session data. We do not consider this a stable interchange format. This means
that we do not guarantee compatibility with future versions of Rekall. At best
the cache files can be deleted and recreated at any time. The content of the
file is also not considered user viewable and should not be edited manually.

Automating Rekall
-----------------

One of our main design goals is the automation of Rekall so it can be used from
external programs easily, as well as making it easier to write custom scripts.

This section demonstrates how to automate the framework, both by embedding it
completely inside another application, as well as simply automating the analysis
from rekall itself.

Example: Embedding Rekall in an external python program
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
In this example we will run the pslist plugin on a sample image, capture the
text table into a string and then print this string (In a real example, this
could be served over a HTTP or whatever).

The basic sequence of steps is:

Create a session object::
 All interactions with the rekall library require a session object. The
 session object keeps information related to the same image. There can be any
 number of session objects valid at the same time - no data is global.

Create an appropriate renderer object::
 All output is rendered using a renderer. A renderer is an abstraction which is
 able to format the output in some way. For example, the TextRenderer outputs
 tables of text, while the JSONRenderer outputs json blobs.

Instantiate the plugin::
 The plugin is simply an object which can be instantiated using various
 parameters.

Render the plugin into the renderer::
 Calling the plugin's render method with a valid renderer will cause it to
 execute its analysis and output into this renderer.

import logging

# Setup logging as required. Rekall will log to the standard logging service.
logging.basicConfig(level=logging.DEBUG)

from rekall import session
from rekall import plugins                           # <1>

s = session.Session(                                 # <2>

  profile_path=[
     "http://profiles.rekall-forensic.com"
  ])

print s.plugins.pslist(method="PsActiveProcessHead") # <4>

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

<1> Importing the plugins is required to make rekall load all the default
    plugins. At this point any third party plugins will need to be imported too.
<2> The session object is created with initial values for some parameters. It is
    critical that Rekall is able to contact the profile repository at runtime,
    therefore you will need to provide a valid repository address here. If you
    plan to use autodetection (you should) here is where the relevant methods
    should be specified.
<3> Rekall will only scan some of the image for RSDS signatures, setting this
    limit ensures that we dont waste too much time trying to load an image we
    cant.
<4> The plugin is instantiated from the session object. When a plugin instance
    is printed, it renders its output to the console by default.


Alternatively one can manually render the plugin output. Suppose you want to
capture the output of the plugin into a string for further processing:

[source,python,numbered]
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
import logging
import StringIO

# Setup logging as required. Rekall will log to the standard logging service.
logging.basicConfig(level=logging.DEBUG)

from rekall import session
from rekall import plugins

from rekall.ui import text

s = session.Session(
  filename="win7.elf",
  autodetect=["rsds"],
  logger=logging.getLogger(),
  autodetect_scan_length=18446744073709551616,
  profile_path=[
     "http://profiles.rekall-forensic.com"
  ])

fd = StringIO.StringIO()
renderer = text.TextRenderer(session=s, fd=fd)   # <1>

with renderer.start():                           # <2>
    plugin = s.plugins.pslist()                  # <3>
    if plugin != None:
        plugin.render(renderer)                  # <4>

print fd.getvalue()
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
<1> Create a custom renderer using any of the renderers provided by Rekall
    (e.g. TextRenderer, DataExportRenderer).
<2> Start the renderer to receive new input.
<3> Instantiate the plugin object. This does not actually run the plugin but
    will verify all the arguments are correct. If the plugin is not active for
    this profile (i.e. it is not supported for this image) this will return a
    NoneObject which can be compared to None.
<4> Rendering the plugin into the renderer will cause the renderer to collect
    output into its file like object. In this case we use a StringIO (memory
    stream) to collect output. Finally we can access the complete content as a
    string.

Receiving structured output.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Most plugins will now return structured output. You can see exactly what will be
returned using the `describe` plugin (See
http://rekall-forensic.blogspot.ch/2016/07/searching-memory-with-rekall.html for
details).

In order to receive structured output you do not need a renderer, simply call the `collect()` method.


[source,python,numbered]
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
import logging

# Setup logging as required. Rekall will log to the standard logging service.
logging.basicConfig(level=logging.DEBUG)

from rekall import session
from rekall import plugins

s = session.Session(
  filename="win7.elf",
  autodetect=["rsds"],
  logger=logging.getLogger(),
  autodetect_scan_length=18446744073709551616,
  profile_path=[
     "http://profiles.rekall-forensic.com"
  ])

for row in s.plugins.pslist().collect():   # <1>
    print "%s, %s, %s" % (
        row["_EPROCESS"].name,             # <2>
        row["_EPROCESS"].pid,
        row["process_create_time"])
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

<1> Instantiating the plugin object allows us to call its collect() method. This
    returns a dict or a tuple of its results.

<2> It is possible to use the results directly now by printing it, storing to
    file etc.


Example: Using a custom address space
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Sometimes the image files to be analyzed are not directly written to disk. For
example, they may be available as a python file-like object. In this case we
want to provide this "virtual image" to Rekall for analysis, but wrapping it in
a 'FDAddressSpace'.

For example consider the following code which provides the image as a python
file-like object (For this example we directly open the file).

       "/home/scudette/images/win7x86.raw"),
    session=s)

print s.plugins.pslist(method="PsActiveProcessHead")

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

<1> We create a session but do not provide a filename.

<2> We can directly add the FDAddressSpace() as the physical address space to
    the session.


Example: Automating the Rekall Console
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Much of the time the Rekall interactive interface is sufficient for most
analysis. Sometimes, however, we need to automate some of this
analysis.

In this section, we see how interactive scripts can be written to automate
Rekall. This is similar to Embedding in an external program, except that the
script runs within the interactive session. When the script completes, the
interactive session resumes.

For this example, we search for all processes with a name of 'python.exe' and
dump them into the temporary directory with their timestamps. This could be used
for example to dump periodic snapshots of a process from a live system.

First we create the following python file named 'dumper.py':

[source,python,numbered]
.Example interactive python script.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
import time

pslist = session.plugins.pslist(proc_regex="python.exe")
pedumper = session.plugins.pedump()

for task in pslist.filter_processes():
    outfd = open("/tmp/%s-%s.exe" % (time.time(), task.UniqueProcessId),
                 "wb")
    pedumper.WritePEFile(fd=outfd,
                         address_space=task.get_process_address_space(),
                         image_base=task.Peb.ImageBaseAddress)
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Now we run this file directly from the interactive shell.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
$ rekal -f \\.\pmem
...

In [1]: run -i dumper.py  <1>
In [2]: ls -l

total 300
-rw-r----- 1 user group  57344 2012-08-27 00:28 1346020082.17-4012.exe
....
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

<1> Running the script with the -i flag ensures that the script receives the
same namespace as the interactive shell. This means that it can use the same
session and we can see all variables defined by the script.


[IMPORTANT]
================================================================================
In the interactive shell IPython will automatically attempt to execute plugins
without requiring the brackets to be present - this is merely a usability
feature. In reality all input is interpreted as python code.

This means that while in the interactive shell it is sufficient to just type
'pslist', when running an external script, you will need to explicitly call the
function as 'pslist()'.

Extending Rekall
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Extending Rekall is most useful when you want to add additional functionality
which should be reused by other people, or contributed to the core. If you are
just interested in automating a very specific analysis, an interactive shell
script is sufficient usually, and is simple to write.

There are a number of different components which can be extended these fall
roughly into these categories:

Address Spaces::
  Address spaces are the way Rekall implements image reading. Most of the
  time you will want to implement some kind of support for new image files.

Renderers::
  All output in Rekall is performed through an abstract renderer. For
  specialist output (e.g. HTML or XML), a new renderer should be written. See
  'BaseRenderer' and 'TextRenderer' as possible examples.

Profiles and specialized parsers::
  Profiles are used by Rekall to parse data structures. Sometimes plugin
  authors wish to extend the parsing system by providing definitions for new
  types, or additional behaviors via new object classes.

Plugins::
  A plugin is a reusable component which is available in the interactive
  session. A plugin should only be written if it can be widely useful and/or can
  be reused by other plugins. It is normally not necessary to write a plugin to
  automate Rekall (e.g. search for a specific malware).
